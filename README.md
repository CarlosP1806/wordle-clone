# Wordle-Style Clone

## ðŸ“ƒ Project Description

This application is my own implementation of the famous word game "Wordle". The objective of the game is to guess the five letter Spanish word that is generated randomly at start. The user has 6 attempts to guess the word, and after each attempt they receive color-coded hints:

-  A gray tile indicates that the letter does not belong to the winner word
- A yellow tile indicates that the letter is in the winner word, but in another position
- A green tile indicates that the letter is in the winner word and in the correct position

I was motivated to build this project in order to practice my front-end react skills, particularly the structuring of components and the use of context. Moreover, I wanted to practice my algorithm design by replicating the functionality of the word game. Visit the deployed game at:

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives 

I built this project taking into consideration the following learning objectives:

- Strengthen my React skills by creating a fully functional front-end word game

- Understand how to manage context in order to avoid passing props through deeply nested components

- Practice my algorithm design skills by replicating the evaluation system of the original Wordle game
